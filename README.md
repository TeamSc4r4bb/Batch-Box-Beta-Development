# Batch-Box-Beta-Development
A simple project that I came up with a year ago. The original game/script contained 1569 lines of batch file but I decided to compress it into less line and to add even more functionalities. I decided to share to the public because I need help with updates and more content to add while keeping it as a relatively small script.
